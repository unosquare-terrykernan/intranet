== Description ==

Wordpress + Office 365 login allows Microsoft O365 users to seamlessly and securely log on to your corporate Wordpress intranet: No username or password required. Why you need this, you may wonder. Because this way you can ensure that your corporate content such as news, documents etc. that is normally classified as "Internal" or maybe even "Confidential" is not available to just any pair of curious unauthenticated eyes!

= Plugin Features =

- As a Wordpress Administrator you can choose between two scenarios: 'Intranet' or 'Internet'.
- When the 'Intranet' scenario is selected, our plugin will secure both Wordpress front- and backend and will try to verify whether the user can successfully authenticate him or herself with Microsoft Azure Active Directory. If this is the case the user is granted access to page initially requested or else the user is redirected to the default Wordpress login page.
- On the other hand, when the 'Internet' scenario is selected and the user requests an ordinary (front-end) Wordpress post or page, authentication is omitted. Only when the user requests a page from the backend e.g. /wp-admin the plugin will try and authenticate the user using Azure Active Directory.
- In both scenarios, users will be automatically logged on after they have successfully authenticated with Azure Active Directory / Office 365
- And in case the user does so for the very first time, the plugin will create a corresponding new WordPress user (and match both worlds by the user's unique email address)
- Still, when a user would navigate to the default Wordpress login page, he or she can still log on using a Wordpress-only account. This maybe desirable for System Administrators to log on independently from any subsystem such as Azure Active Directory.
- To keep things save, the plugin will by default prevent Office 365 users to change their email address.
- The plugin will also prevent Office 365 users to request a new password.
- After a certain time - by default 1 hour - the plugin will try and refresh the initial authentication.

= Premium Features =

The [premium version](https://www.wpo365.com/downloads/wordpress-office-365-login-premium/) of the plugin offers all of the above, plus:

- Access Control based on users being a member of either an Office 365 or an Azure AD Security group
- Automated WordPress Role Assignment based on a configurable mapping between Office 365 or Azure AD Security groups and WordPress roles
- Plain WP_CONFIG configuration (improves the overall performance of your website)
- Integration with Microsoft Graph

Also have a look at [this post](https://www.wpo365.com/wpo365-login-features-and-authentication-flow/) if you need help to decide whether or not our plugin can help you improve the user experience when user try to gain accessing to your corporate intranet or internet WordPress site.

= Prerequisites =

- We have tested our plugin with Wordpress 4.8.1 and PHP 5.5.0 and 5.6.25
- You need to be (Office 365) Tenant Administrator to configure both Azure Active Directory and the plugin
- [Redux Framework Plugin](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/redux-framework/) to configure the Plugin’s option (a warning will be shown upon plugin activation)
- You may want to consider further restrict access to the otherwise publicly available wp-content directory
- A user's browser must support cookies

We haven't been able to test our plugin in all endless possible Wordpress configurations and versions so we are keen to hear from you and happy to learn!
